                    <p>I’m a Design & Technology student at Parsons School of Design exploring how creativity, data, and storytelling intersect. My work bridges physical computing, interactive media, and brand experience design using technology not just as a tool, but as a medium for connection and change. I’m passionate about designing systems and stories that are both aesthetically engaging and socially meaningful.</p>

                    <p>My practice is rooted in experimentation and prototyping; from coding generative visuals in p5.js to building interactive systems with Arduino and sensors. I’m driven by curiosity and iteration, often developing ideas through hands-on exploration, play, and testing. I see each project as a dialogue between research and making, where technical skill and conceptual thinking inform one another.</p>

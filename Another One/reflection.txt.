For me, learning HTML for this portfolio website was surprisingly enjoyable. I found the structure and organization of HTML genuinely digestible and the way elements kind of stack logically and that it was very easy to read for me and each tag had clearly defined content which made the coding process feel a lot simpler rather than overwhelming. Overall, I wanted the website to feel clean, simple, and professional, so it could showcase work easily. The minimalist navigation, clear typography hierarchy, and restrained layout let the content sit without unnecessary visual clutter. If I had more time I think I want to get a little more creative with maybe some transitions or more interactive parts, but for now I enjoy the way my website looks and operates. Working in HTML taught me that good code structure and good visual design don’t have to be separate; they work together. I think for me being able to separate the large chunks for the smaller details made more sense.
